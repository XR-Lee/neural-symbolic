In the provided bird's-eye view (BEV), the green and blue lane segments are highlighted. The white arrow represents the driving direction of the green segment, and the magenta arrow points from the mid point of the green segment to that of the blue segment. At the top right corner of the image, two arrows with the same directions are drawn in white and magenta, which can be referred to.
